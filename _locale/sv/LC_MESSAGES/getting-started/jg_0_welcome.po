"The aim of the jamovi guide is to provide short, non-technical tutorials on "
"how to conduct common statistical procedures in jamovi. However, it is not a"
" resource providing an in-depth introduction into the background of those "
"procedures. For such an endevaour, there are plenty of other resources, e.g "
"the free e-book `learning statistics with jamovi "
