jamovi guide
============

   The aim of the jamovi guide is to provide short, non-technical tutorials
   on how to conduct common statistical procedures in jamovi. However, it is
   not a resource providing an in-depth introduction into the background of
   those procedures. For such an endevaour, there are plenty of other
   resources, e.g the free e-book `learning statistics with jamovi
   <https://www.learnstatswithjamovi.com/>`__
