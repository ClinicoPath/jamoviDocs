"``Nominal`` and ``Ordinal`` are, predictably, for nominal and ordinal "

"considered to be *Interval* or *Ratio* scales (Equivalent to ``Scale`` in "
"SPSS). The ``ID`` measure type is, unlike the others, unique to jamovi. It’s"
" intended for variables that contain identifiers that you would almost never"
" want to analyse. For example, a persons name, or a participant ID. The "
"advantage of IDs, is that jamovi does not need to maintain a list of levels "
"internally, which can improve performance when interacting with very large "
"data sets."

"When starting with a blank spreadsheet and typing values in, the data and "

"This is a good way to get a feel for which variable types go with which "
"sorts of data. Similarly, when opening a data file, jamovi will infer the "
"variable type from the data in each column. In both cases, this automatic "
"approach may not be correct, and it may be necessary to manually specify the"
" data and measure type with the variable editor."

msgstr ""

#: ../../user-manual.rst:270

"Filters in jamovi allow you to filter out rows that you don’t want included "

"Once a data set is set up with filters, computed variables, transforms and "

"number of reasons – It might be that you have a new data set, that you want "
"to apply the analyses you performed earlier to it, or you may be conducting "
"an experiment where you’re tesing a number of participants, and you now have"
" an additional participant’s data to analyse. By importing into an existing "
